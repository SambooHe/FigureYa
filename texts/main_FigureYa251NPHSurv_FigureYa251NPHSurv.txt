需求描述 Requirement
Description
用了两种非比例风险的预后模型来计算接受了免疫治疗的队列的生存差异，包括RMS限制性生存均值以及long-term
survival分析。这个在临床中很有意义，因为免疫治疗患者确实存在他说的“delayed
effect”延迟效应。
The author used two non-proportional risk prognostic models to
calculate the difference in survival in the cohort that received
immunotherapy, including RMS-limiting mean survival and long-term
survival analysis. This is very meaningful in clinical practice, because
immunotherapy patients do have the “delayed effect”.

应用场景 Application
Scenarios
采用非比例风险的生存模型（non-proportional-hazard survival model,
NPHSurv）评价接受免疫治疗患者的预后情况
The non-proportional-hazard survival model (NPHSurv) was used to
evaluate the prognosis of patients receiving immunotherapy
original text：
To evaluate the treatment effect of immune
checkpoint inhibitors on different iCSs in the IMvigor210
cohort
, we compared the RMS time difference at six months and
one year after treatment. We found that the iBS4 subtype showed a
significantly poorer outcome than immune-hot iCSs (i.e., iBS1 and iLS2;
both P < 0.05 at 6 months, both P < 0.1 at 12 months) and had a
segregated survival curve compared to the immune-cold iLS3 subtype
(Supplementary Figure S4a). Due to the *
delayed clinical effect
of immunotherapy
, we also compared the long-term survival rates
after three months of treatment. Consistently, the iBS4 subtype was
associated with significantly poorer long-term survival than the
immune-hot iBS1 (P = 0.046) and iLS2 (P = 0.027) subtypes and the
immune-cold iLS3 subtype (P = 0.095), suggesting its high malignancy and
potential resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (Supplementary Figure
S4b).
Xiaofan Lu写了一个神奇的R包 MOVICS，用自己的数据跑一遍，文章里的key
Figure就出来了。
怎么把这些图组织到一起讲故事呢？这篇文章是个很好的应用MOVICS的例子。
Xiaofan Lu wrote a magical R package MOVICS, ran his own data, and
the key Figure in the article came out.
How to organize these pictures together to tell a story? This article
is a good example of applying
